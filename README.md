=========

What is it?
-----------
WitherShot is a simple, lightweight plugin designed to let you shoot wither skulls from your bow! If you've ever battled the Wither, you know how he shoots the wither skulls from his head â€“ well, now you can become the Wither!

With a simple command, you can switch from using wither skulls to arrows to wither skulls to arrows! You can fire out the wither skulls on other players and deal damage and the wither poison effect to your enemies! This also makes a great donor command as well by using the simple permission system that is built into the plugin!
